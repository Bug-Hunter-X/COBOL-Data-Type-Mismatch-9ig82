This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle error in COBOL programs: data type mismatch. The bug involves using a field defined with PIC X (alphanumeric) in contexts expecting numeric data. This can lead to unexpected results or runtime errors. The solution involves careful data type definition and explicit data type conversions if necessary.  The included COBOL files illustrate both the problematic code and its corrected version.
